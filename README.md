# Synapse-AI-Pulse-Oximeter
Synapse’s second feature involves a smart, automated Pulse Oximeter that accurately and remotely measures heart rate (HR) and blood oxygen saturation (Spo2  level) of patients. This feature is really important because it helps patients prevent blood clots, sudden cardiac arrests, and heart failure. The Pulse Oximeter utilizes camera sensors embedded into all smartphones as well as with photoplethysmography (PPG) biosensors that accurately measure heart rate (HR) and blood oxygen saturation (Spo2  level) of patients. As a patient places their index finger over the rear camera sensor system, the PPG sensor measures the distension of arteries and arterioles in the subcutaneous tissue (thanks to blood flow from each cardiac cycle). As blood flows through the vessels, the pulse pressure is detected by illuminating the skin with the light from two inorganic light-emitting diodes-OLED (embedded in a majority of camera sensors). The amount of light transmitted, absorbed, or reflected to a photodiode is measured and processed by Synapse’s AI, which contains an algorithm that detects and interprets the PPG signal to determine HR and Spo2 values. Finally, additional AI framework within the app then accesses and displays individual biosensor readings on the Smartphone screen.
